# react-node

This project has 2 folders: **client** (React) and **api** (Express)

In each folder, just setup and run with npm:
```
npm install
npm run
```

**Client** will run in port 3000

**API** will run in port 9000

With both running, React will request http://localhost:9000/testAPI and display the message "API is working properly"

Else, it'll display "API not working"
